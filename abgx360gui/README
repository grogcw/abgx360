abgx360gui requires wxWidgets 3 or newer
(http://wxwidgets.org/downloads/) and a terminal emulator such as
gnome-terminal, xterm, the Windows **cmd** or **powershell** utilities, or the
macOS Terminal application.

To install the dependencies on Debian/Ubuntu based systems:
sudo apt-get install libwxgtk3.2-dev xterm

To compile abgx360gui using CMake:
mkdir build && cd build
cmake ..
make

To run abgx360gui (from the build directory):
./abgx360gui
OR
use your favorite file manager to browse to this folder and double click on abgx360gui

NOTE: This is just a GUI, you need to have abgx360 installed in order to do anything useful

If you encounter this error:
                wxWidgets must be installed on your system.

                Please check that wx-config is in path, the directory
                where wxWidgets libraries are installed (returned by
                'wx-config --libs' or 'wx-config --static --libs' command)
                is in LD_LIBRARY_PATH or equivalent variable and
                wxWidgets version is 3 or above.

First check that wx-config exists in your path (normally /usr/local/bin); it
might be named something else like wxgtk2-2.8-config, and you will need to create
a symbolic link named wx-config in order for the configure script to find it.

Example: sudo ln -s /usr/local/bin/wxgtk2-2.8-config /usr/local/bin/wx-config
